# Neurovision

Neurovision is a WebGL app that renders a visualization of the function learned by a neural net, while it is training, so that the evolution of this function can be watched in real-time.

The neural net is trained to classify three species of iris based on measurements, using [Fisher's iris database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) as training data. While this database contains measurements of four different features, only two are used as input to the neural net, due to the limitations of 2D visualization.
